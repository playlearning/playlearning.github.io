  - title: Generative Models of Visually Grounded Imagination
    date: 2018-11-09
    proceeding: ICLR 2018
    pdf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10762.pdf
    code: https://github.com/google/joint_vae
    motivation: People can imagine images with different visual concepts (man with pink hair).
    results: Make generative models can imagine compositionally novel concrete and abstract visual concepts. Evaluate model with correctness, coverage, compositionality.
